# International_Debt_Statistics
Analyzing international debt statistics using SQL
This is an analysis of the international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We will find the answers to questions such as:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
